                        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                        bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an
                        amazing experience here. I signed up
                        for the free intro course and found it incredibly
                        fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                        time of my life. Since completing
                        the course, I've successfully switched careers,

                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it duborder interviews as an example of my developent 
                            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
